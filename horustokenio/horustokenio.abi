        ## Description
        The intent of the {{ stakehorus }} action is to stake HORUS tokens for access to the HorusPay Payroll Portal database and to mint the digital asset ECASH.

        As a HORUS token holder I {{ from }} wish to stake {{ stake_horus_quantity }} to {{ receiver }} granting the {{ receiver }} access to claim staking rewards.  A minimum of 10.0000 HORUS must be staked to participate in staking rewards.  Rewards are earned by staking HORUS tokens for longer than 7 days.  After 7 days payouts can be claimed in the form of ECASH.  ECASH is rewarded proportionally to the amount of HORUS staked and will be issued at a 1% monthly rate of the staked HORUS for a stake greater than or equal to 1 million HORUS, and at a 0.1% monthly rate for any stake less than 1 million.  In the future when the HorusPay Payroll Portal is fully released, the 1 million HORUS token threshold will be removed and all stakes will mint ECASH at a 0.1% monthly rate.  After the 7 day vesting period the staking durration will automatically be renewed for the owner {{ from }} to continue claiming rewards.  This action may change at a later point in time."
