## Description

This contract allows for the creation of eosio compatible tokens under the class name `horustokenio`.  This is based off the eosio.token contract (https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/master/contracts/eosio.token).

## Actions
### create

Standard currency create action.  Creates a new token asset.

### issue

Standard currency issue action.  Issues tokens to specified accounts.  Requires issuer permission.

### transfer

Standard currency transfer action.  Transfer tokens between two accounts.

### stakehorus

This action lets a HORUS token holder stake their tokens for themselves (or another account) in order to get access to claim staking rewards.
A minimum of 10.0000 HORUS must be staked to participate in staking rewards. Rewards are earned by staking HORUS tokens for
longer than 7 days. After 7 days payouts can be claimed in the form of ECASH. ECASH is rewarded proportionally to the amount of
HORUS staked and will be issued at a 1% monthly rate of the staked HORUS for a stake greater than or equal to 1 million HORUS,
and at a 0.1% monthly rate for any stake less than 1 million. In the future when the HorusPay Payroll Portal is fully released,
the 1 million HORUS token threshold will be removed and all stakes will mint ECASH at a 0.1% monthly rate. After the 7 day vesting
period the staking durration will automatically be renewed for the owner {{ from }} to continue claiming rewards. This action may
change at a later point in time.

```bash
cleos push action horustokenio stakehorus '["from","receiver","1.0000 HORUS"]' -p from
```
ex:
```bash
cleos push action horustokenio stakehorus '["alice","alice","1.0000 HORUS"]' -p alice

cleos get table horustokenio alice stakedhorus
{
  "rows": [{
      "id": 0,
      "from": "alice",
      "to": "alice",
      "horus_weight": "5.0000 HORUS",
      "time_initial": 1534699728
    }
  ],
  "more": false
}
```

### unstakehorus

Unstake tokens back to the staker.  There is a 7 day delay to unstake.

```bash
cleos push action horustokenio unstakehorus '["from","stake_id"]' -p from
```

### claimreward

```bash
cleos push action horustokenio claimreward '["owner","stake_id"]' -p owner
```

### refundhorus

Called when unstaking to refund the staked tokens over a period of time.

```bash
cleos get table horustokenio owner refunds
```
